# Lucvis Project
Lucvis is a project related to data visualization, presenting social networks about scientific collaboration between researchers from five Brazilian Universities: UnB, USP, UFRN and UFMG, with the modeling of the network made using the concept of graphs. Current implementation are acessible in http://lucvis.herokuapp.com/.

Developed during the scientific initiation project (PIBIC), during the undergraduate course in Computing at the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB), it is also part of the InfoKnow group, which researches and develops computer systems for solving problems involving the processing of information and knowledge.
# Occupation area
For the formation of the database for the construction of the social network, information about authors and publications from the scientific environment is collected from the digital repository [DBLP](https://dblp.org/).
# Technologies and used concepts
  - [Angular Framework](https://angular.io/) (Typescript / Javascript, HTML, CSS)
  - Graph-based Database System [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com)
  - Javascript libraries for visualization of graph-based data: [3d-Force](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph), [Neovis](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neovis.js)
